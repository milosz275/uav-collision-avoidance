# UAV Collision Avoidance
Python project regarding implementation of UAV physics and collision detection/avoidance algorithms.
[Archived version](https://github.com/mldxo/uav-collision-avoidance-2)

## Introduction
UAV Collision Avoidance is my bachelor's thesis project meeting problem of UAVs safe cooperation in the 3D space. Project implements functional physics calculations, scalable GUI, realistic ADS-B probable collision avoidance systems and on-board flight planning.

## Premises
3-dimensional space defined in XYZ coordinate system, where X and Y describe flat horizontal plane and Z is height above the sea level. In scope of this project, UAVs are considered HTOL drones (Horizontal Take-off and Landing). The space is shared by two/three UAVs. There is no other objects or gusts of wind assumpted. The default distance unit is meters [m] and speed is meters per second [m/s]. There is no aerodynamic lift force assumed at this moment.

## Technologies
Python3[^1] project is wrapped as a PyPi package[^2]. PySide6[^3], which is PyQt6 library, was used for GUI implementation.

## Structures

## Algorithms

## Usage
~~Use `pip install uav-collision-avoidance` to install the app~~ or build it by cloning the repo and running the following commands:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd uav-collision-avoidance
python main.py
```

## Remarks
One coding convention is not preserved in the scope of the project. Qt's methods are CamelCase formatted and the rest is snake_case, default Python naming convention.
