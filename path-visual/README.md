# Generated test results

This directory contains a structured collection of directories representing 10 distinct tests. Each test represent a unique scenario where the collision avoidance system is evaluated using generated parameters.

- The first image in each test iteration captures the scenario with collision avoidance turned off.
- The second image in each test iteration depicts the same scenario with collision avoidance enabled.

These images serve as a visual comparison to assess the effectiveness of the collision avoidance system under various conditions. Collision is defined as the paths intersecting witout further path after.

## Directory Structure

The directories are named sequentially from `simulation-0-id-hash` to `simulation-9-id-hash`. Inside each of these directories, you will find:
